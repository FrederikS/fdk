question: What are the different access modifiers available in Java?

There are four types of Access modifiers:

- `public` – accessible from everywhere in the application
- `protected` – accessible within the package and the subclasses in any package
- package private (Default) – accessible strictly within the package
- `private` – accessible only within the same class where it is declared
