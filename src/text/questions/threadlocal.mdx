question: What is the ThreadLocal class? How and why would you use it?
---

A `ThreadLocal` instance is used to individually manage a state/value per
thread. Whenever it is used inside a thread, it accesses its own independently
initialized copy of the variable. Each thread holds an implicit reference of a
`ThreadLocal` variable as long as the thread is alive. It provides a simple way
to make code thread safe.

```java
public class Playground {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        var threadLocal = new ThreadLocal<Integer>();

        final Runnable runnable = () -> {
            threadLocal.set((int) (Math.random() * 100D));

            try {
                Thread.sleep(2000);
            } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {
            }

            System.out.println(threadLocal.get());
        };

        final Thread t1 = new Thread(runnable);
        final Thread t2 = new Thread(runnable);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();
    }

}
```
