question: What is type erasure?
---

Generics are checked at compile-time for type-correctness. The generic type
information is removed in a process called type erasure. For example
`List<Integer>` will be converted to the non-generic type `List` containing
arbitrary `Objects`. Because of that, type parameters cannot be determined at
run-time.
