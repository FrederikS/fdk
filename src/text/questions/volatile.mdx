question: What is the volatile keyword? How and why would you use it?
---

The `volatile` modifier guarantees, that any thread that reads a field, will see
the **most recently written value**.

These variables are directly written to and read from the main memory instead of
the CPU cache. Reading and writing to main memory is more expensive.

If two thread are reading and writing to a shared variable, where the new value
is generated based on the previous value (needs a read before writing), volatile
is not enough. The short time gap between reading and writing creates a race
condition, where multiple threads might read the same value and overwrite each
others value. In that case you need to use `synchronized` keyword (or
`AtomicReference`, `AtomicInteger`, ...) to guarantee atomic reads and writes.

One common use-case for using `volatile` is for a flag to terminate a thread.

```java
public class Foo extends Thread {

  private volatile boolean close = false;

  public void run() {
    while(!close) {
      // do work
    }
  }

  public void close() {
    close = true;
    // interrupt here if needed
  }
}
```
