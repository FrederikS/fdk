question: Describe and compare fail-fast and fail-safe iterators.
---

**fail-fast**: Operates directly on the collection itself. Whenever the
collection is modified while iterating it throws a
`ConcurrentModificationException`. (e.g. `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`)

**fail-save**: Operates on a cloned copy of the collection. Does not throw an
exception when it gets modified while iterating. (e.g. `ConcurrentHashMap`,
`CopyOnWriteArrayList`)
