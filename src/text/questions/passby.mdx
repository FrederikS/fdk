question: Is Java pass by reference or pass by value?
---

Java is **always** pass by value.

It means the argument is copied to the parameter variable, so that the method
operates on the copy. When the value of an object is passed, the **reference**
to it is passed. If a reference points to a mutable object like an `ArrayList`
and gets changed inside a method, the originally passed variable is also
affected. Since passing an object as argument also means that the reference to
the object is copied. As a result, both variables(original and parameter) refer
to the same object.

```java
public class Playground {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int n = 1;
    increaseAndMultiply(n);
    System.out.println(n); // still 1
  }

  public static void increaseAndMultiply(int n) {
    n++;
    System.out.println(n * n); // 4
  }

}
```

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Playground {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    var list = new ArrayList<>(List.of("foo", "bar", "foobar"));
    mutate(list);
    System.out.println(list); // prints [foo, bar]
  }

  // object reference is passed by
  public static void mutate(List<String> list) {
    list.remove("foobar");
  }

}
```
