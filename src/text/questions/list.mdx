question: Where would you use LinkedList and where an ArrayList?
---

`ArrayList` is to be preferred, when you have a lot of random access via
`List.get(n)`. Even more, when elements are appended instead of being inserted
at a specific index. Both operations have a complexity of O(1)<sup>\*</sup> for
`ArrayList`. `LinkedList` has a higher complexity of O(n) for random access via
`List.get(n)`. But prepending elements has a lower complexity of O(1) for
`LinkedList` compared to O(n) for `ArrayList`. Same applies to the removal of
the first or last element in the list. Also, insertions and removals of elements
at a specific index are on average faster for `LinkedList`. Therefore a
`LinkedList` is preferable when you rather have prepends, head/tail removals or
removals and insertions at a specific index, while you do not have a lot of
random access.
