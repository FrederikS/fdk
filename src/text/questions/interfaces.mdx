question: What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
---

Abstract classes specify **what an object is**, by defining characteristics of an
object type. They can have a constructor and can hold a state.

Interfaces are used to establish a contract about **what an object can do**.
They define capabilities that are promised to be provided by an implementing
object.
