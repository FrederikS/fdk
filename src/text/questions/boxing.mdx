question: What is unboxing and autoboxing in java?
---

Autoboxing is the automatic conversion the java compiler makes between the
primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. For example,
converting an `int` to `Integer` or a `double` to `Double`. If the conversion
goes the other way, its called unboxing.
