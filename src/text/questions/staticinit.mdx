question: What are static initializers and when would you use them?
---

A `static` initializer gives you the opportunity to run code during the initial
loading of a class and it guarantees, that this code will only run once and will
finish before your class can be accessed in any way.

```java
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Playground {

  private static final Map<String, Boolean> FEATURE_FLAGS;

  static {
    final Map<String, Boolean> flags = new HashMap<>();
    flags.put("cool-feature", true);
    flags.put("lame-feature", false);
    FEATURE_FLAGS = Collections.unmodifiableMap(flags);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // {lame-feature=false, cool-feature=true}
    System.out.println(FEATURE_FLAGS);
  }

}
```
