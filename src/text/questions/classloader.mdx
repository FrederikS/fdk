question:
  What is the Java class loader? List and explain the purpose of the three types
  of class loaders.
---

The Java `ClassLoader` is part of the JRE and is used to load classes at runtime
on demand (lazy-loading) into the JVM. These classes can be loaded from a local
or remote file system or even from the web. When the JVM is started **3** kinds
of `ClassLoader` are used.

1. **Bootstrap class loader** - The JVM built-in class loader, which defines the
   classes in a handful of critical modules, such as `java.base`.

2. **Platform class loader** - All classes in the Java SE Platform are
   guaranteed to be visible through the platform class loader. In addition, the
   classes in modules that are standardized under the Java Community Process but
   not part of the Java SE Platform are guaranteed to be visible through the
   platform class loader. (e.g. `java.net.http`)

3. **System class loader**, also known as **application class loader**, that
   defines classes on the application class path and module path. It is the
   default loader for classes in modules that are neither Java SE nor JDK
   modules. The platform class loader is a parent or ancestor of it, so it can
   load platform classes by delegating to its parent.
