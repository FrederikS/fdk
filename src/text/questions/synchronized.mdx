question: What is the synchronized keyword?
---

Synchronized blocks can only be executed by a single thread at a time. They can
thus be used to avoid race conditions. Without the `synchronized` keyword there
are no guarantees about when a variable, that is kept in a CPU register by one
thread, is written to or refreshed by reading from the main memory. By using the
`synchronized` keyword, all variables visible to the thread are refreshed before
entering the block and all changes to variables will be committed back to the
main memory when leaving the block. For more advanced locking semantics
Read/Write Locks are used. There are `Lock` interface implementations, which can
be used for reading and/or writing with an optional fairness policy for the
acquisition order enabled.
