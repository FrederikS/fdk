question: What is the native keyword in Java? When is it used?
---

The native keyword in java is applied to a method to indicate that the method is implemented in platform native code using JNI (Java Native Interface) / JNA (Java Native Access). They are implemented in other languages, not in java.
Use-cases could be that you need to call a library from java written in another language or you need to access system or hardware resources that are only reachable from other languages (typically C).
