question: What is the native keyword in Java? When is it used?
---

The `native` keyword in java is applied to a method to indicate, that a method
is implemented in platform native code using JNI (Java Native Interface) / JNA
(Java Native Access). They are implemented in other languages, not in java. For
example, if you need to call a library from Java that is written in another
language or if you need to access system or hardware resources that are only
accessible from other languages (typically C).
