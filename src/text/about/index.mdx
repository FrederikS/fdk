Hi!

I'm Frederik a 29 years old software developer currently living in Berlin.
Most of the time I am focused on **backend development** and always eager to learn new technologies.
Currently I'm very interested in topics like **clean code**, **reactive programming** and **event-driven architectures**.
The purpose of this site is to share my experiences when I have time to be innovative.
