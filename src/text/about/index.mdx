Hi!

<p>I'm Frederik, a {new Date().getFullYear() - 1990} years old software developer, currently living in Berlin.
Most of the time I am focused on <b>backend development</b> and always eager to learn new technologies.
Currently I'm very interested in topics like <b>clean code</b>, <b>reactive programming</b> and <b>event-driven architectures</b>.
The purpose of this site is to share my experiences whenever I have time to be innovative.</p>
