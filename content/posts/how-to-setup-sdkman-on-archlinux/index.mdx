For java development it is often necessary to be able to switch between different jdk versions.
One way of handling this, is to use SDKMAN and this is my machines' setup.

### Installation

There is one AUR package available called `sdkman` but its seems to be an unofficial sdkman client.
To use the official one you should follow the instructions from [here](https://sdkman.io/install). It is pretty fast and easy.
Basically you install it via curl from the command line.

```shell
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```

This command installs all necessary scripts and files you need in your home directory.

#### Basic Configuration

And to have a proper initialized sdkman for each shell session you have to add one line to you `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

```shell:title=~/.zshrc
[[ -s "/home/dudette/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh" ]] && source "/home/dudette/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
```

Of course you need to replace the home directory name accordingly to your username or you might use something like `$HOME` from your env here.
To avoid collision with java installed on system level it is useful to `unset` the default system java environment by using the `archlinux-java`
script that comes along with the `java-runtime-common` package.

```shell
sudo archlinux-java unset
```

### Usage

So far so good. We are ready to use sdkman. To install a java version we check which of them are available.

```shell
sdk ls java

```

To install one of the candidates we are using the identifier from the last column of the output table.

```shell
sdk install java 11.0.3.hs-adpt
```

Whenever you want to switch from one version to another you either use the `use` or `default` command.
The different between those is that `use` only changes the version for the current shell and `default` will change it for every shell.

```shell
// changes version for current shell
sdk use java 14.0.0-open

// changes version for every shell
sdk default java 14.0.0-open
```

### The tricky part

As long as you only working from the in your shell everything is working fine.
But in case you want to work with an IDE like **vscode-java** and you are not starting it from the command line
the current configured java version is not picked up properly.
Why not and how does it work? There are several ways for **vscode-java** to define the jdk path that should be used.

1. the `java.home` setting in VS Code settings (workspace then user settings)
2. the `JDK_HOME` environment variable
3. the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable
4. on the current system path

These are the steps and the order of how it tries to find the correct jdk path. Lets go through them.
First option to use `java.home` would be easy, but it only fixes the problem for **vscode-java** and other applications would still have issues.
Last option wont work since sdkman and candidates are installed in our users directory and not on system level.
Second and third option seems to be the way to go.
I chose `JAVA_HOME` because it seems to be more the standard of what is used by the majority of applications.

#### What is the problem? Sdkman exports the according environment variable.

Indeed, sdkman already exports the proper `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, but only on shell scope.

```shell
echo $JAVA_HOME

/home/dudette/.sdkman/candidates/java/current
```

We need it globally so that it is also picked up by application that are spawned by our window manager.
Normally you would define global environment variable somewhere in `/etc/environment` or `/etc/profile`.
But since sdkman runs on our user level it is a bad idea to put something user specific at system level and other users would get into trouble.

### Enable the environment variable globally for an user

What we want is to define it global but only for our user.
One way to do it, is to use the `systemd` daemon and put or environment variable to a conf file into our `~/.config/environment.d/` directory.

```shell:title=~/.config/environment.d/sdkman.conf
JAVA_HOME=/home/dudette/.sdkman/candidates/java/current
```

After a reboot or a re-login of your user `JAVA_HOME` should get picked up by **vscode-java** and other applications.
Because the value here points to a symlink it will also work whenever you switch java versions.

### Goody for ZSH users

For those who are enjoying completions for zsh, they are also available for SDKMAN.
Follow the instructions from [here](https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli/blob/master/zsh/README.md) to set them up.

Happy version switching!
