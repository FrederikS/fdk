Currently, I am looking for a new job. Ideally, I'd like to work for something
that is really meaningful to me. Anyways, after a one-year break from daily
programming business, I thought it's time to get myself prepared again. Of
course, I did not stop programming and learning - maybe I learned even more than
I would if I were employed. But it is under other circumstances and very broad,
I like to try out all kinds of things I read about and found interesting, be it
different programming languages, new concepts, techniques, libraries or
frameworks.

When you look at job postings though, most companies are looking for
specialists. There are also some, that are searching for generalists, but expect
them to be specialists for everything. Since I think that this is not a healthy
expectation that one can and should live up to, I have thought about what I am
most likely to be a specialist in, although I see myself more as a generalist.

I still don't know the answer, but I know that I worked for the most time with
Java. That is what companies would also see when they look at my resume. So, I
decided to refresh my java knowledge by starting to go through some interview
question that circulate on the web. Finally, I made a collection of questions I
liked and added some more details to the answers, but also some basic questions,
or questions that led me to other questions I liked to have an answer for. I am
pretty sure that there are a many more interesting questions and whenever I'll
come across them, I'll extend my collection. And these questions I'd like to
share with you.
